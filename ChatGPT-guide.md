## Personalize It

Before using ChatGPT, go to your profile and select **Personalize**.

It's important to give ChatGPT instructions on how you want it to chat with you.  

What do you do Section? 
Describe your role , expertize, etc, so the answers can be tailored to you.
Sample: Software engineer, Project manager, Business owner.

What Traits Should ChatGPT have? Give instructions on how you want ChatGPT to respond to you.

Sample Example instructions:

- Be very science-oriented, not very verbose.
- Write in a direct, personable, and casual tone.
- Be straightforward and helpful, not exuberant or overly upbeat.
- Avoid jargon. Use clear, plain language — clarity is more important than style.
- Use bullet points, numbered lists, and tables to structure information.
- Cite all sources in APA style (in-text and in a references section).
- If the question is unclear, ask clarifying questions — don’t guess.
- It's fine to be critical, negative, or push back — only be positive when it fits.

Words to Avoid: Do not use fluffy motivational language. Avoid marketing clichés and jargon.

## Use Temporary Chat

Use **Temporary Chat** for one-off queries you don’t want ChatGPT to remember — e.g., vacation planning.

Example Prompt: You are an experienced data analyst. Given the following raw data, explain the key findings

## Use reasoning models for data analysis and calculations
Use o3 Pro for most logic or science related chats.

## Custom GPT vs Projects

Bellow is a table comparing Custom GPT and Projects and when to use each.

| Feature                | Custom GPT                         | Projects                               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Purpose                | Personal assistant, chatbot tuning | Multi-step workflows or tool-based logic |
| Access                 | Profile → Explore GPTs             | ChatGPT UI → "Projects" tab            |
| Custom Instructions    | Yes                                | Yes                                    |
| Memory Usage           | Uses memory                        | Can use memory (if anabled)            |
| File Uploads           | Supported                          | Supported                              |
| Tools (e.g., Python)   | No                                 | Yes (via Actions)                      |
| Use Case Example       | Customer support bot               | Automation for financial analysis      |
